OpenGL/GLES C Framework

Uses Kazmath for most of the math

SELF NOTE ->

CODING STYLE:
   When adding new object structures, functions related to those must have the structure name as prefix or as
   suffix depending which makes more sense.

   eg. typedef struct {} dlObject;
   dlRotateObject( dlObject*, params.. ); or dlObjectFreeTextures( dlObject*, params.. );

   Arguments should also make sense.
   If it's operation function for object, then the object should always be the first argument.

   If the object can be used outside of the library, then it _SHOULD_ have a reference counter
   and following operation functions :
   dlObjectNew()        - Allocation
   dlObjectCopy( src )  - Copy
   dlObjectRef( src )   - Reference
   dlObjectFree( obj )  - Free

   You are also encouraged to use the memory managment functions provided in dlAlloc.c/h
   dlMaloc()
   dlCalloc()
   dlRealloc()
   dlFree()

   Since they have some sanity checks and keep track of the memory.
   If it's internal object or variable then it's not needed to use these, and usually encouraged to not.

   Declariations and code should also not be mixed, put all declarariations at top of the function.

   Variable names should almost always be something you can easily understand.

   I usually use something_this_variable_does naming scheme, but in this project I thought of going with
   somethingThisVariableDoes scheme and it seems to work quite well so far.

   For iterators using variable like i or i2 and such is OK as long as you don't mix it up.

   Defines and enumerations should always be in uppercase and have a prefix eg. IMAGE_FORMAT_JPEG.

   There should never ever be extern variables, with expection of library core struct.

   Whenever I spot new styles that help me read the code a lot, I usually go and change my old stuff,
   sometimes I might forgot some places however.

   Might add more to remind myself, when something useful pops up into my mind :)

   Freeing objects :
   if the object has any reference counted objects, free them first!
   then free only the current object members which are not reference counted when
   object's reference hits 0.

   dlFreeObject( dlObject *obj )
   {
      /* free members which are ref counted,
       * and mark as NULL, when they are truly freed */
      if( dlFreeRefObject( obj ) == RETURN_OK ) obj = NULL;

      /* check if we still have reference on this object */
      if( --obj->refCounter != 0 )
         return( RETURN_NOTHING );

      /* free members which are not ref counted */
      free( obj->awesome_array );
      obj->awesome_array = NULL;

      /* free the object itself */
      free( obj ); obj = NULL;
   }
